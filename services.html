			<p>Recognizing the fact that usability, functionality and visualization are three of the most important factors when designing interfaces or web sites, I have developed a strategy along with working with you to ensure that your messaging and marketing goals are realized with the designs we create together.</p>
			<p>I focus on gathering as much of your company's information through a pre-development survey before the design is started. By adhering to this practice we are able to develop a design concept that will meet both your expectations and your marketing goals.</p>
		<div class="services-title">Development</div>
		<div class="services-body">
		<p>HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the backbone of all web design projects. It is of utmost importance that every site I develop be well organized, using the latest HTML and CSS standards along with incorporating JavaScript and other tools to give your site a clean and friendly responsive theme.</p>
		<p>The goal is to ensure a friendly user experience, as well as lay the groundwork for optimal search engine exposure.</p></div>
